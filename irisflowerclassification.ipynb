    "- That would be like giving students the exact same questions on the test that they studied from\n",

    "- **y_test**: Species labels for testing (hidden from model)\n",
    "- Used to **evaluate** how well the model learned\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Parameters Explained:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`test_size=0.2`**: 20% for testing, 80% for training\n",
    "- **`random_state=42`**: Ensures the same random split every time you run the code\n",
    "  - Without this, you'd get different splits each time\n",

    "# How Model Evaluation Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at this code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "class_report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What This Cell Does:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we **grade** the model's performance by comparing its predictions to the correct answers!\n",
    "\n",
    "## **The Three Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Accuracy Score**\n",
    "`accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it measures:** Overall percentage of correct predictions\n",
    "- **Formula:** (Correct Predictions / Total Predictions) × 100\n",
    "- **Example:** If 28 out of 30 predictions are correct → 93.3% accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Confusion Matrix**\n",
    "`conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it shows:** Detailed breakdown of correct vs incorrect predictions\n",
    "- **Format:** A 3×3 grid showing:\n",
    "  - **Rows:** True species (what they actually are)\n",
    "  - **Columns:** Predicted species (what model guessed)\n",
    "  - **Numbers:** How many times each combination occurred\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Confusion Matrix:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "           Predicted\n",
    "         Set  Ver  Vir\n",
    "Actual Set [10   0   0]  ← All Setosa correctly identified\n",
    "       Ver [ 0   9   1]  ← 1 Versicolor misclassified as Virginica  \n",
    "       Vir [ 0   0  10]  ← All Virginica correctly identified\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Classification Report**\n",
    "`class_report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it provides:** Detailed performance metrics for each species\n",
    "- **Includes:**\n",
    "  - **Precision:** Of all flowers predicted as Species X, how many were actually Species X?\n",
    "  - **Recall:** Of all actual Species X flowers, how many did we correctly identify?\n",
    "  - **F1-score:** Balanced measure combining precision and recall\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Why Each Metric Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** Quick overall performance check\n",
    "- **Confusion Matrix:** Shows exactly where the model makes mistakes\n",
    "- **Classification Report:** Reveals if the model is better at identifying some species than others\n",
    "\n",
    "## **The Big Picture:**\n",
    "These metrics tell us if our model is ready for real-world use or needs improvement!"
